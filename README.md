**You're welcome**

[It's a link to a website that I made](https://search-github-users23.netlify.app/)

What I used in this project:

- Expand the project to React and yarn (instead of npm). Use SCSS(module.scss) instead of CSS".

- Good layout on mobile.

- For Navigate I`ve used React Douter 6

- Created Error and Login Pages 

- I've have done authentication and authorization for my web application

- Working with useContext() instead of other State management libraries

- Working with UseState hook

- Working with UseEffect hook

- Sending a request to the backend with axios and rendering this data

- [For UserPage I used blobanimation](https://blobanimation.com/)

- [For Error Page I used just background](https://app.haikei.app/)

- [Button I got here](https://cssbuttons.app/buttons/5)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
